# Simple simulation for Stochastic processes

Letâ€™s take into consideration the mathematics of a simple experiment, the rules of the experiment are as follows:

*There are two players, one X, and the other Y*

1. *Each takes a turn to flip a fair coin.*
2. *Before flipping this coin, each one bets one dollar(only because it sounds cool) on the outcome.*
3. *If we get heads X wins all the money (1 dollar of Y and takes back his own dollar as well), similarly, if we get tails Y takes all the money.*
4. *The game will go on until X wins 50 dollars or lose 50 dollars*
